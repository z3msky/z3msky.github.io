                    "Narcissus and Trains" is an exploratory project made throughout the VR Game Development course at DePaul which combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with Unity's XR tools to create a surreal space using novel rendering techniques.

                    "Searchlight" is a real-time 3D scene programmed in DirectX 11. From models created in Maya, to the scene and graphics API written in C++ and DX11, "Searchlight" is built from the ground up.

                <p>
                    <b>Lighting</b> - The indoor sections are lit with a warm directional light, and by the three Phong lights associated with the lamp. The lamp casts an even glow on the room with a point light centered on the bulb, and casts two spotlights upwards and downwards
                    to create the illusion of a semi-transparent lampshade casting shadows on its light. The outdoor sections are lit with a cooler directional light that gives the effect of a moonlit night, 
                    as well as a spotlight spilling across the cityscape from the helicopter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Terrain</b> - The outdoor terrain is made up of three graphic objects. Two flat planes make up the city pavement and calm water. Finally, the island visible in the distance is a terrain object generated from a heightmap image.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Fog</b> - The terrain objects are rendered with exponential squared fog, implemented in the pixel shader, which simulates atmospheric scattering and fades textured colors by distance using a user-defined fog color and density.
