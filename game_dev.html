        <h4>2024, Sole Creator</h4>
        
        <p>
            Gossip World is hardly a game - it is a digital fishtank that simulates the lives and drama of a procedurally generated friend group
            of self-serving socialites. The player takes a passive role as an audience to the evolving relationships between simulated, randomized 
            actors who have been carefully designed to be shallow, scheming, and so, so <i>in</i>. Built in Unity for Art Games Workshop, lead by Professor Briank Schrank at DePaul,
            Gossip World is an experiment in storytelling and indirect narrative design, and an homage to the TV show Gossip Girl.

        <h3>Ketchup Beat!</h3>
        <h4>2023, Sole Creator</h4>
        <p>
            Ketchup Beat! is an extension for Ketchup Engine which adds rhythm game systems such as a song player with consistent timing and song synchronization,
            gameplay objects such as notes and lanes, and tools for reading rhythm game charts from a MIDI file. Throughout development, new features were also added to
            the base engine, such as an improved UI system and a new heightmap-based terrain system. Below is a clip of gameplay from the demo game made to demostrate these features.

        <p>
            Ketchup is a 3D game engine developed by Haru Zemsky throughout the 2022-23 Winter and Spring quarters at DePaul's CDM.
            Built on CDM's Azul graphics library, Ketchup provides easy-to-use services for managing updating and drawing game objects, entities, and scenes.
            Ketchup also provides services for event-based mouse and keyboard input, single and repeating alarms and collision. 
            Additionally, Ketchup provides the user with dev tools such as a visualizer for invisible objects, an on-screen log, and the KMath math library.
