        <h3>Ketchup Engine</h3>
        <p>Ketchup is a 3D game engine developed by Haru Zemsky throughout the 2022-23 Winter and Spring quarters at DePaul's CDM.
            Built on CDM's Azul graphics library, Ketchup provides easy-to-use services for managing updating and drawing game objects, entities, and scenes.
            Ketchup also provides services for event-based mouse and keyboard input, single and repeating alarms and collision. 
            Additionally, Ketchup provides the user with dev tools such as a visualizer for invisible objects, an on-screen log, and the KMath math library.
