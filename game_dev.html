        <p>
            Ketchup is a 3D game engine developed by Haru Zemsky throughout the 2022-23 Winter and Spring quarters at DePaul's CDM.
            Built on CDM's Azul graphics library, Ketchup provides easy-to-use services for managing updating and drawing game objects, entities, and scenes.
            Ketchup also provides services for event-based mouse and keyboard input, single and repeating alarms and collision. 
            Additionally, Ketchup provides the user with dev tools such as a visualizer for invisible objects, an on-screen log, and the KMath math library.

        <h3>Ketchup Beat!</h3>
        <h4>2023</h4>
        <p>
            Ketchup Beat! is an extension for Ketchup Engine which adds rhythm game systems such as a song player with consistent timing and song synchronization,
            gameplay objects such as notes and lanes, and tools for reading rhythm game charts from a MIDI file. Throughout development, new features were also added to
            the base engine, such as an improved UI system and a new heightmap-based terrain system. Below is a clip of gameplay from the demo game made to demostrate these features.
